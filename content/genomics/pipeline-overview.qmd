## Overview of variant calling pipeline

The chart below provides a high-level overview of the different steps involved in the processing of genomic data. In the following chapter we will focus on the variant calling pipeline, which deals with:

- Assessing the quality of sequence reads and filtering if necessary.
- Aligning the reads to a reference genome - this is also referred to as _read mapping_.
- Identify variants, i.e. where do my samples differ from the reference genome - this is known as _variant calling.

In the diagram below the various tools (e.g., `bwa`, `samtools`, `gatk`) and data formats (`fastq`, `bam`, `vcf`, etc.) are depicted as well. Some of these we have already encountered in the previous chapters. You might also recall the pipeline scripts (stored in `./training/scripts`) that were mentioned in the chapter on Unix scripting. These already showcased with a number of the different steps involved in the pipeline.
